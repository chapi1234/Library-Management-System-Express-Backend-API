## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running locally or on a cloud service

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system-express-backend-api.git
   cd library-management-system-express-backend-api
   ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB=mongodb://localhost:27017/Library-Management-System
   SECRET_KEY=secretkey
   EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   ```

   - Replace `your-email@gmail.com` and `your-email-password` with your actual email credentials.
   - **Important**: Ensure that your `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in version control.

4. Start the server:
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

  The server will start running on http://localhost:5000.
